        The Department of Computer Technology, YCCE organised a 3 Days Bootcamp on C Programming on 6th April 2023, 10th April 2023 and 11th April 2023 at Pioneer Students Council, Dattatreya Nagar, Nagpur. The Bootcamp was conducted by Prof Supriya Thombre and Ms. Sakshi Kokardekar on C Programming for the students of 11th Std. The students got to learn about all the fundamentals and basic concepts of C Language. Hands-on-Sessions were also conducted every day in order to help students improve their programming skills. Overall, the Bootcamp was a success and received positive feedback from the students as well as the management of Pioneer Students Council.  It was a valuable learning experience for students to understand the concepts of C programming in order to get started with programming.

<h3 class="text-center">Day 1</h3> 
<p>
  On 1st day, i.e. 6th April 2023, the students were introduced to C Language and why is their a need to learn C Language. After that, basic concepts of C Programming were introduced to the students like Basic Programming Structure, Header Files, Format Specifiers, Data Types, Print Statements, How to take user input, Conditional and Looping Statements. Simultaneously, the students tried to execute the codes using online compiler, in which they got actual hands-on-experience about what coding is like and their queries were been solved at the same time.

    On 2nd day, i.e. 10th April 2023, the students were taught about Arithmetic and Logical Operators, Arrays, Strings, Switch Case, Continue and Break Statements. Also, some practice problems were given to the students which helped them clear their programming concepts. At the end of Day 2, the students were able to code basic programs like calculator designing, Calendar based problems, Prediction Problems, etc. on their own.

  On 3rd Day, i.e. 11th April 2023, the students were taught in detail about Functions, Recursion and also some basic concepts about DSA like Queue, Stack, etc. Based on these, again some practice problems were given to the students which helped them clear their doubts and polish their programming concepts. At the end of Day 3, the students were able to implement what has been covered in all the 3 days and gained some confidence in their programming abilities.</p>
