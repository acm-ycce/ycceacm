          <p style="text-align: justify;
          text-justify: inter-word;">
            “Reverse Coding” was organised under CofeChef YCCE Chapter for the first time in it’s history.
            It was not that orthodox coding of writing a code for the given problem statement. But, as the
            name suggests, participants were actually made to do the reverse of it. Here, the participants were
            provided with input, output, constraints and some sample test cases. No problem statement was
            mentioned and the participants had to write the code based on the given conditions. Mr. S
            Akshansh and Mr. Amit Bhagat grabbed first and second position respectively.
